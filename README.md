# How do I approach designing software?
Designing software requires a deep understanding of the problem that you are working with as well as a strong understanding in the tools to solve the problem. With this course, we were aiming to solve the problem of creating a 3D environment that represents a real-life photo that we took. In solving this problem, it is helpful to learn about 3D APIs such as OpenGL to find the best way to solve this problem. Furthermore, taking the time to develop milestones along the way towards the ultimate goal allows for learning and mistakes to occur in an effort to remove as many mistakes from the final product at the end.

# How do I approach developing programs?
I always take a modularized approach to developing programs and in this course that is no different. For this particular course we had milestones to tackle along the way, allowing us to develop different sections of our project, making it easier to understand and ultimately bring it all together in the end.

# How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Computer Science is a foundational skill in game development. This class in particular is very useful in my pursuit of learning game development as I learned a lot of the underlying themes that go into creating a fully featured game. Furthermore, computer science is a very powerful knowledgebase to draw from for any real-world problems as automation and computers are some of the most efficient ways to tackle our day-to-day problems.
